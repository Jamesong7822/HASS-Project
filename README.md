HASS Final Project

The dataset was from a science fiction section of a science magazine website: [click me](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/category/fiction/science-fiction/)
The urls of all the downloaded articles are available [here](https://github.com/Jamesong7822/HASS-Project/blob/master/urls.text)

Downloaded articles are accessible [here](https://github.com/Jamesong7822/HASS-Project/blob/master/Articles/rawdata.txt)

The words of the articles are then cleaned, and processed (to remove stopwords and such etc.) and can be found [here](https://github.com/Jamesong7822/HASS-Project/blob/master/processed.txt)

Finally, the code that did the downloading of the data, words processing and topic modelling is found [here](https://github.com/Jamesong7822/HASS-Project/blob/master/NLP.py)

Thank you very much! :smile:
